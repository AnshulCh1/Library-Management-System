# ðŸš€ Library Management System | Python, SQL

I developed a **Library Management System** to streamline the process of book management, member registration, and transaction tracking.  
Using **Python** and **SQL**, the system enables users to:
- Add books
- View available titles
- Issue and return books
- Keep track of all transactions  

With an easy-to-use terminal interface and a robust backend, this system is ideal for small libraries or personal use.
